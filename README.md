# 🔐 Network Security Threat Detection — End-to-End MLOps Project

This project implements a **full-stack, end-to-end MLOps pipeline** for detecting network security threats using structured data, modern ML techniques, and CI/CD practices. From **ETL pipelines** to **model training**, **cloud deployment**, **Dockerization**, and **self-hosted runners**, this project demonstrates production-ready ML system design using industry-standard tools.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n network_security python=3.10
conda activate network_security
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

* Built as a Python package (`setup.py`)
* Configured for easy reproducibility

---

## 🔄 ETL Pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load)

| Stage         | Details                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Extract**   | Data pulled from `APIs`, `S3 Bucket`, `MongoDB`, `Paid APIs` |
| **Transform** | JSON processing, basic cleaning, KNN Imputer                 |
| **Load**      | Pushed to `MongoDB Atlas`, `AWS DynamoDB`, `SQL`, `S3`       |

### MongoDB Details

* Database: `network_security`
* Collection: `network_data`
* Ingestion script: `push_data.py`
* Records Pushed: **11,055**

.env file securely stores connection strings (not pushed to GitHub)

---

## 📥 Data Ingestion Module

Key Features:

* Export MongoDB data to Pandas DataFrame
* Save feature store to avoid repeated DB queries

Artifacts:

* `ingestion_artifact.pkl`
* Feature store cache for optimized pipeline runs

---

## ✅ Data Validation

* Checks schema consistency
* Validates data drift between train/test sets using statistical thresholds
* Ensures training integrity

---

## 🔄 Data Transformation

* Implements **KNN Imputer** for missing values
* Applies feature engineering on top of ingestion artifacts

---

## 🧠 Model Training

| Feature        | Description                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **MLflow**     | Tracks experiments, metrics, artifacts         |
| **Dagshub**    | Remote Git repo + MLflow tracking              |
| **Algorithms** | Logistic Regression, Tree-based models         |
| **FastAPI**    | Exposes trained model as a prediction API      |
| **Swagger UI** | Interactive test interface for model endpoints |

> Note: Resolved common connection issues with Dagshub during model training.

---

## ☁️ Cloud Integration

### ✅ AWS S3

* Stores final models and pipeline artifacts
* Bucket versioning enabled

### ✅ IAM & AWS CLI

* Configured using a secure IAM user for AWS SDK
* S3 bucket operations via Python SDK

---

## 🐳 Docker & CI/CD

### Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t network-security-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 network-security-app
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`main.yaml`)

* Triggers on push/merge to `main`
* Builds Docker image
* Pushes to AWS ECR

#### GitHub Secrets Used:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
ECR_REPO
AWS_ECR_LOGIN_URI
```

## 🚀 Final Deployment (EC2 Self-Hosted Runner)

> 💡 **Why EC2 over EKS?** MVPs and low-cost deployments are ideal for EC2 runners.

| Feature          | EC2 Self-Hosted | EKS (Kubernetes) |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 💸 Cost          | ✅ Low           | ❌ High           |
| ⚙️ Complexity    | ✅ Simple        | ❌ Complex        |
| 🔁 Auto Recovery | ❌ Manual        | ✅ Built-in       |
| 🔗 Use Case      | MVP, Demos      | Production Scale |

### Steps:

1. Create EC2 (t2.medium)
2. Setup Docker, connect EC2 to GitHub as self-hosted runner
3. Enable port access on **port 5000**
4. Final run: `./run.sh` on EC2 terminal
